## Introduction
Recipe Jam is a collaborative recipe recommendation and exploration platform designed to help users discover meals based on their available ingredients, dietary preferences, and personal constraints. By combining user input with an intelligent recommendation engine, Recipe Jam provides an interactive and personalized cooking experience from ingredient selection to final recipe guidance.

Users can input ingredients they currently have, specify dietary restrictions, allergies, preferred cuisines, and available kitchen tools. Based on this information, Recipe Jam generates relevant recipe suggestions, complete with required ingredients, step-by-step cooking instructions, recommended tools, and possible substitutions. This allows users to reduce food waste, save time, and experiment confidently in the kitchen.

Additionally, Recipe Jam helps users plan ahead by tracking previously generated recipes and automatically creating shopping lists for missing ingredients. Through an intuitive interface and data-driven recommendations, Recipe Jam aims to simplify home cooking while encouraging creativity and flexibility in everyday meals.
